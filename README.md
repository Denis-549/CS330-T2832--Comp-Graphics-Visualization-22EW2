The process of designing software involves understanding requirements and making sure each functionality truely represent the needs of the client or end user. From  development perspective, i think working progressively, modularizing and using methods that enables code to be reusable helps. 
I really appreciate learning how to apply how users with different input or rather limited input devices would be able to navigate a 3D scene and ultimately have the same experience by way of the "W, S, A, D" keyboard keys. There is also the ability to pan the object around the center pivot point by holding the "Alt" key on the keyboard and left clicking on the mouse. Using the functions of UKeyboard, UKeyReleased, UMouseMove, and UMousePR allowed me to learn how to code which specific key to press in order to perform the zoom in and out and moving left to right tasks.
I think starting off with wireframes, building,running/testing before proceeding is crytical and time saving in terms of catching errors and ensuring design principles are adhered to. 

There environments I have experienced that implement or integrate graphics into UI/UX experiences for end users, so being able to learn how to apply how users with different input or rather limited input devices would be able to navigate a 3D scene and ultimately have the same experience by using the "W, S, A, D" keyboard keys is very helpful and one that I will be using in the future.
Modularizing code, testing/trying as you go, revising code line by line when necessary and applying inline commenting is very important in development. Also keeping all your vertices in one VAO and only drawing some vertices at once , as well as implementing or using gTableMesh and a gCupMesh for texturing different objects in a 3D scene is helpful during development.  
One major development strategy I have learnt to use especially in creating 3D scenes is first knowing that OpenGL uses right handed coordinates. I also finding normals for vertices and being able to translate those to actual normal looking 3D objects. 

Iteration and/or incremental development did help a lot in terms of avoiding syntatical errors, but also being able to build each scene progresively i.e. one piece at a time, seprating objects (vertices) within my code by seprating them and including inline comments (descriptions) to identify each. 

Building each piece or aspect of a scene from a plain 2D object, to 3D, to adding color coordinates, to lighting, to textures to being to make it interactive did help me get from understanding to be doing in terms of developing code to make it all happen. 

Computer sceince helps me understand the fundamentals of how computing works from creating graphics, helping hardware perform the tatsks they do, to simulating human behavior. Computer scince is helping me understand how I can be able to help the human society be more efficient, productive, creative and properous. 

Being that the field of computing requires a lot more than just being to build clean, functional and meaningful code, computational graphics and visualizations helps me to be prepared to approach software design and development from a different UI/UX perspective. Software design requires a deeper understanding of both software development and the ability to make your work visually meaningful and engaging.
